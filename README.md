G&C (Good & Cheap) is a web application with the objective of ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns in our cities. Reducing food waste at the retail and consumer level is the main focus of this application.

The application will provide users with a marketplace where shops around them will publish products close to their expiration date, at a cheaper price. Users will have the ability to buy these products and reduce the food waste around their community.

The application will also provide different recipes for the user to elaborate using the products they have bought. These recipes will provide a way of taking advantage of those products and reduce the waste of food at retail.
